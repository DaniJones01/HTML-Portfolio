<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Danielle Jones, I'm an IT professional with interest in Full Stack Enginering. I'm currently studying Web Development courses to further my development skills.</p>

<p>During working hours, I'm an Product Support Analyst for Bullhorn. I support 3 different products and assist my team as our API and SQL SME. My team leadership values my autonomy and ownership of customer cases that vary in complexity and severity and my ability to create solutions and timely resolutions. </p>

<p>My current goal is to join a team as a Software QA Engineer. I hope to transfer into this role within the next 6 months or a similar role with a career path in this direction.</p>
